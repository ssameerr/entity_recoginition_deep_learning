# Entity recognition using Deep Learning

Please visit my [medium link](https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/entity-extraction-using-deep-learning-8014acac6bb8) to see the explanation of the project. As explained in the post, the project is based on [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html)â€™s blog about sequence tagging work. 

There are changes made to the orginal work of [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html), but some of the code base remain same for the below:
* model.py - the code base is taken [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html)'s work and it got modifed to the need.
* dataobject.py - some of the code base is taken from [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html)'s work
* data_utils.py - some of the code base is taken from [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html)'s work
* config.py - some of the codebase is taken from [Guillaume Genthial](https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/sequence-tagging-with-tensorflow.html)'s work
